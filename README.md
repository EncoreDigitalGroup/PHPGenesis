# PHPGenesis/PHPGenesis

PHPGenesis is a collection of PHP Libraries developed by [Encore Digital Group](https://github.com/EncoreDigitalGroup)
that are designed to make PHP development easier and more efficient. The libraries are designed to be modular and can be
used independently or together.

# We Love Laravel

Encore Digital Group writes primarily Laravel Applications. Therefore, a large portion of PHPGenesis is designed to work with Laravel.

# What's Included

Encore Digital Group has a number of PHP libraries, separate from PHPGenesis, that are included in PHPGenesis. Some of these libraries include:

- [StdLib](https://github.com/EncoreDigitalGroup/StdLib)
- [SDK-Client-Foundation](https://github.com/EncoreDigitalGroup/SDK-Client-Foundation)
- [Tachyon](https://github.com/EncoreDigitalGroup/Tachyon)

Using these libraries, PHPGenesis provides:

- [Amazon Web Services](./src/Services/AmazonWebServices/README.md)
- [Common](./src/Common/README.md)
- [Logger](./src/Logger/README.md)

There are more libraries that will be added to PHPGenesis in the future. We are currently in the process of extracting these libraries
from our internal projects and making them available to the public.

# Installation
